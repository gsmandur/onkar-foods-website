# onkar-foods-website

A website for Onkar Foods built with HTML/CSS/JS and Bootstrap

special thanks to https://startbootstrap.com for providing a template

### Basic Usage

After downloading, simply edit the HTML and CSS files included with the template in your favorite text editor to make changes. These are the only files you need to worry about, you can ignore everything else! To preview the changes you make to the code, you can open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

### Advanced Usage

After installation go to `website` subfolder, run `npm install` and then run `npm start` which will open up a preview of the template in your default browser, watch for changes to core template files, and live reload the browser when changes are saved. You can view the `gulpfile.js` to see which tasks are included with the dev environment.

You must have npm and Gulp installed globally on your machine in order to use these features.

## future updates

- change header image to something more suitable
- replace stock images in services section with own pictures
- add a quick contact sub heading that gives the phone numbers for all the store locations
- update menu pdf to look nicer
- more consistent font body

## Special thanks
